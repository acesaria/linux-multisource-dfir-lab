# Linux Multi-Source DFIR Lab

[Canonical repository](https://github.com/acesaria/linux-multisource-dfir-lab)

Linux Multi-Source DFIR Lab supports a Master's thesis on reproducible Linux
post-mortem DFIR experiments. It runs controlled compromise scenarios in
isolated VMs, acquires disk and memory evidence, and supports manual
investigation with Sleuth Kit, Plaso, and Volatility 3 across filesystem,
timeline, and memory sources.

The project is research infrastructure, not a production SIEM, EDR, malware
sandbox, live-response platform, automatic detector, or automatic
reconstruction system.

## Current repository surface

The CLI exposes `init`, `setup`, `build`, `run`, and `destroy`. `build` publishes
a scenario's prebuilt artifact and is required before running that scenario.
`run` dispatches directly to one of five scenario keys:

- `interactive_shell`;
- `kernel_ebpf_badbpf`;
- `kernel_diamorphine`;
- `ptrace_fa`;
- `userland_father_ldpreload`.

A full run restores the prepared baseline, executes and validates the selected
scenario, acquires memory while the VM is on, shuts the VM down, acquires disk,
and then stops. Investigation-time tools produce only the outputs the analyst
needs; cross-source interpretation and conclusions are human work.

Current runs use manifest schema v3 and are recorded as `vanilla`. There is no
runtime selector for a hardened security profile. Distro definitions exist for
Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04, and Debian 13, but Ubuntu 22.04 is the current
deep-analysis platform. Broader replication and optional scenarios must not
delay the minimum thesis deliverables.

## Evidence and run records

Each run is rooted under `shared/experiments/<run_id>/`. An acquired run keeps:

```text
manifest.json                         run identity, lifecycle status, revision, sidecar index
command_log.jsonl                     append-only scenario operations and commands
terminal_transcript.txt               human-readable scenario terminal record
dumps/acquisition.json                acquisition commands, hashes, verification, image metadata
```

The root manifest is a small lifecycle index, and the acquisition sidecar is the
authority for acquisition provenance. A successful `--no-acquire` run keeps the
root records but no acquisition sidecar; it validates only the scenario and is
not a complete forensic experiment.

Accepted evidence and raw exports are immutable. Other generated caches may be
recreated, but accepted run material must not be overwritten. Tool failures,
zero-result tools, and source-scoped negative observations remain distinct.

## Repository layout

```text
cli.py                    command entry point
infra/                    libvirt/QEMU, Ansible, images, distro definitions
orchestrator/core/        lifecycle, VM state, configuration, run paths
orchestrator/forensics/   acquisition and investigation/verification runners
scenarios/                explicit scenario runners and command logging
docs/investigations/      scenario/run notebooks, accepted reports, comparative material
shared/                   generated run evidence, exports, and local analysis
```

Operational identifiers such as the `forensic-lab` CLI name, schema names, guest
paths, and evidence artifacts are retained when they are part of the working
system or a recorded run.

## Basic use

Create the local configuration and virtual environment first:

```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
./setup-venv.sh
```

Then use the repository interpreter:

```bash
.venv/bin/python cli.py init
.venv/bin/python cli.py setup --distro ubuntu-22.04
.venv/bin/python cli.py build --distro ubuntu-22.04 \
  --scenario userland_father_ldpreload
.venv/bin/python cli.py run --distro ubuntu-22.04 \
  --scenario userland_father_ldpreload
```

### Pinned image and prebuilt inputs

Ubuntu eventually prunes dated cloud-image release directories, so the pinned
URL may return 404. Before downloading, `infra.image_store.ensure_image` checks
`<state_dir>/images/<filename>` and verifies it against the profile checksum; an
exact image obtained elsewhere can therefore be placed at
`/var/lib/forensic-lab/images/ubuntu-22.04-20260515-server-cloudimg-amd64.img`.
Verification, not the transfer source, controls acceptance. Prebuilt inputs are
not committed: run `build` before `run` for every scenario that consumes one.

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0444 /path/to/ubuntu-22.04-20260515-server-cloudimg-amd64.img /var/lib/forensic-lab/images/ubuntu-22.04-20260515-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
```

### Complete experiment command sheet

```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
./setup-venv.sh
.venv/bin/python cli.py init
.venv/bin/python cli.py setup --distro ubuntu-22.04
.venv/bin/python cli.py build --distro ubuntu-22.04 --scenario userland_father_ldpreload
.venv/bin/python cli.py build --distro ubuntu-22.04 --scenario ptrace_fa
.venv/bin/python cli.py build --distro ubuntu-22.04 --scenario kernel_diamorphine
.venv/bin/python cli.py build --distro ubuntu-22.04 --scenario kernel_ebpf_badbpf
.venv/bin/python cli.py run --distro ubuntu-22.04 --scenario userland_father_ldpreload
.venv/bin/python cli.py run --distro ubuntu-22.04 --scenario ptrace_fa
.venv/bin/python cli.py run --distro ubuntu-22.04 --scenario kernel_diamorphine
.venv/bin/python cli.py run --distro ubuntu-22.04 --scenario kernel_ebpf_badbpf
# Evidence: shared/experiments/<run_id>/
```

### Host prerequisites

The host runs Linux with KVM available. On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system virtinst cloud-image-utils \
                 libewf-dev sleuthkit plaso-tools ansible python3-venv
pipx install volatility3          # or any install exposing the vol3 binary
sudo usermod -aG libvirt,kvm "$USER" && newgrp libvirt
```

The lab VM is reached over SSH with a dedicated key, whose paths are declared in
`config.yaml`:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/forensics-lab -N ""
```

`cli.py` verifies, before each command, only the binaries that command will
actually use, and stops with an explicit list if any is missing. Passwordless
sudo inside the disposable guest is a documented deployment precondition, not an
emulation of initial compromise.

Volatility symbol tables (ISF) are **generated**, not distributed: `cli.py setup`
builds the table for the guest kernel and writes it under `shared/isf/`. A fresh
clone therefore starts without them, by design.

## Documentation

- `METHODOLOGY.md` defines the thesis and investigation method, including the
  evidence-status vocabulary and the fixed result-reporting contract.
- `GUIDELINES.md` defines how a manual investigation notebook is produced.
- `docs/investigations/` holds the accepted case summaries, the source notebooks
  and the single cross-case comparative table.
- `scenarios/<id>/README.md` documents each controlled treatment's behaviour.
- Named investigation documents apply only to their cited immutable runs.

## Third-party components

Compromise techniques are not reimplemented here. Each scenario vendors a
pristine upstream archive pinned to a specific commit and verified by hash; the
pin, the archive hash and the licence are recorded in the scenario's
`*.lock.yml`, and the prepared artefact is built on a separate builder VM that
never becomes the system under examination.

| Scenario | Upstream project | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `userland_father_ldpreload` | [Father](https://github.com/mav8557/Father) | Unlicense |
| `kernel_diamorphine` | [Diamorphine](https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine) | BSD-3-Clause |
| `kernel_ebpf_badbpf` | [bad-bpf](https://github.com/pathtofile/bad-bpf) | BSD-3-Clause / GPL-2.0 |

The forensic toolchain (The Sleuth Kit, Plaso, Volatility 3, libewf, libvirt,
QEMU) is used unmodified and is not redistributed by this repository.

Previous automatic detection, matching, scoring, and reconstruction work is
historical. Its final checkpoint is preserved by the immutable
`automatic-reconstruction-v3-final` tag and must not be treated as the current
architecture.
