# Investigation documents

New investigation notebooks use the exact manifest identifiers:

```text
docs/investigations/<scenario_id>/<run_id>/
  runme_disk_investigation.md
  runme_memory_investigation.md
  runme_timeline_investigation.md
  runme_case_summary.md
```

Create only the source notebooks that exist. Add `runme_case_summary.md` only
after the applicable source notebooks have been accepted. Its two summary
tables are the fixed per-artifact evidence matrix and the source metric summary
defined in `../../ai/archive/METHODOLOGY.md`; cross-source interpretation follows them.
A run-specific source notebook pins `RUN_ID` once, derives other case paths and
parameters from the run metadata, and writes new output beneath:

```text
shared/investigations/<run_id>/derived/<source>/
```

Acquired evidence and raw exports remain under `shared/experiments/<run_id>/`
and are never copied into `docs/`. The ignored `shared/investigations/` tree is
the analyst workspace; `docs/investigations/` holds versioned notebooks and
accepted narrative records.

Do not create a separate scenario template until at least one reconstructed
run has completed and the reusable cells have been reviewed. Existing flat
reports remain in place until they are deliberately superseded.
